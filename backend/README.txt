Musts before testing:
- Install Node.js (if not already)

# Install React
cd ./frontend/spotstitch/
    npm i react



## How to run ====================================

# Must run server first ----

To run server (from root folder):
    cd backend
    nodemon app
    # Must be in ./backend folder since app.js in is there, and nodemon runs that file

----


To run frontend (from root folder):
    cd frontend/spotstitch
    npm run start
