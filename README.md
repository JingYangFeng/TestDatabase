# Musts before testing:
- Install Node.js (if not already)
    https://nodejs.org/en/download

## Install React
cd ./frontend/spotstitch/
    npm i react



# How to run

# Must run server first

To run server (from root folder):
- cd backend
- nodemon app
- Must be in ./backend folder since app.js in is there, and nodemon runs that file



To run frontend (from root folder):
    cd frontend/spotstitch
    npm run start


All instances of users will appear on the page, even newly added ones, without refresh


## Finding User information(from root folder):
    cd ./backend/schema/schema.js
    you will find "Const UserType" which lists all user information

# for more specifics and documentation
    cd ./backend/models/user.js


**Please make a new branch if you are on main
